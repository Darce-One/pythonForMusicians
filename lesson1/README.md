# Lesson 1

## Lists

A basic list tutorial can be found in `lists.py`.

## NumPy Arrays

You'll need to first install numpy in your virtual environment.

In this tutorial series, we're using numpy version 1.26. This version can be installed in a conda environment with `conda install numpy=1.26`.
For other types of virtural environments, you can use `pip install numpy=1.26`.

A basic introduction to numpy arrays can be found in `arrays.py`.
A more formal introduction to numpy can be found here: `numpy for beginners: https://numpy.org/doc/1.26/user/absolute_beginners.html`.
