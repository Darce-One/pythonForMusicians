# Oscillator shapes

This lesson tackles oscillator shapes, and creating them directly using numpy arrays.

This lesson starts in `sawtooth.py`. The text blocks in code will walk you through how to think about approaching oscillators and introduce the phasor.

Then, make your way to `triangle.py`, where you'll adapt your phasor to sculpt a triangle wave.

Once that's done and digested, check out `square.py`. That script will introduce the concept of pulse-width, and a way to generalise it to skewing other wave shapes, including saw, triangle and even sinewaves.

Finally, you could check out `oscillators.py` for a brief review, and a look at how you could create functions for these waveshapes. I encourage using classes however, a topic we'll cover in the next few lessons.
