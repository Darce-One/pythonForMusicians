This assignment was given at the end of lesson 2.

Learning Outcomes of the assessment:
    - Understand creating arrays
    - Ability to recognise what to try
    - Ability to read the documentation when "hunting"


Assessment Brief:
    Create plot of 10 uniformly random points in range [-1:1]
    Give the plot a title, and label the axes appropriately.
    You may start from this template:
"""

# Importing libraries
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def main():
    # Your code goes here. Replace the 'None' statements with what you need

    # Creating the x-axis with 10 points:
    x_array = None

    # Creating 10 uniformly random points in range [-1:1]
    y_random = None

    # Plotting code:
    plt.plot(None)

    # Adding a Title, xlabel and ylabel
    None
    None
    None

    # Show the plot
    plt.show()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
